# CountryApp
Hello to everyone,
In order to download this application and build it seamlessly, you need to import the sdwebimage package into your application.
If you already have the sdwebimage package then there is no problem.

Installation with Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)
Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.

SDWebImage support SwiftPM from version 5.1.0. To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency, enter SDWebImage repo's URL(https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage).
Or you can login Xcode with your GitHub account and just type SDWebImage to search.

After select the package, you can choose the dependency type (tagged version, branch or commit). Then Xcode will setup all the stuff for you.
